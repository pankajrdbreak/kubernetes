# Multi-container Pods

As name suggest a pod with more than one conatiner in it is called as Multicontainer pod.
The multi-container pods are the pods that contain two or more related containers that share resources like network space, shared volumes, etc and work together as a single unit. Basically, these helper processes or containers enhance the main containers by providing additional functionality.

In multicontainer pods there is content-generator which will create content continously and put it into shared volume and then this volume is accessed by main-container which will display the content.

The container is not get terminated after pulling the content.It will work as a side car for the main container


# Example
Pod with 2 containers one container is getting memory status and saves into shared volume on continous basis and that shared data is used by another container.

```console
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: multi-container-demo2
spec:
  containers:
  - name: data-displayer
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    volumeMounts:
    - name: data-dir
      mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"
  - name: data-provider
    image: busybox
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'while true; do echo $(free -m) >> /datadir/index.html && sleep 5; done']
    volumeMounts:
    - name: data-dir
      mountPath: "/datadir"
  volumes:
  - name: data-dir
    emptyDir: {}
```

Here the memory status content is generated by "data-provider" container and saves to /datadir in index.html file every 5 seconds.
The "data-displayer" container is serving the content of index.html from shared volume
