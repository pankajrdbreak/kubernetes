Docker container is by default accessible from the container itself only.
But if we want access the container from the host and outside then we have to do port mapping.
We have to expose the ports at the time of creation of container
Below is the command to create container
$ sudo docker run -td --name nginx -p 80:80 nginx:alpine

Now you can access nginx web server from host as well as outside using
You can access from host using :
http://localhost:80 also and using below also
You can access from outside the host using :
http://ip_address_of_node_running_container:80
